# Vacation Planner

This project is a web application you can use to plan a vacation to the most popular tourist destinations in the US and across the world! By inputting your preferred destination from a list of over 300 cities worldwide, you will be prompted to choose an itinerary of activities from a list of popular things to do in your chosen city. Next, this application will run an algorithm which utilizes the google maps API to find the location of your activities. This algorithm will autonomously plan your vacation, providing the optimal route through your selected activities, minimizing travel time and accounting for the reccomended time to spend at each activity. All of this information will be displayed in an user friendly web page which allows the user to adjust and customize their vacation schedule to fit their needs.
