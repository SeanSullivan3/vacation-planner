# Vacation Planner

This project is a web application you can use to plan a vacation to the most popular tourist destinations in the US and across the world! By inputting your preferred destination from a list of over 300 cities worldwide, you will be prompted to choose an itinerary of activities from a list of popular things to do in your chosen city. Next, this application will run an algorithm which utilizes the google maps API to find the location of your activities. This algorithm will autonomously plan your vacation, providing the optimal route through your selected activities, minimizing travel time and accounting for the reccomended time to spend at each activity. All of this information will be displayed in an user friendly web page which allows the user to adjust and customize their vacation schedule to fit their needs.  
  
This README file will contain:
 -  A brief overview of how this application works and the programming behind it.
 -  Instructions to run this application on your own machine.
 -  A video demo.  

## How Vacation Planner Works

This web application is a fullstack software engineering project with focus on front-end design in HTML, webscraping techniques in Python, and algorithmic programming with graph theory. Here is a little bit about what I did to put this project together...
* How it works:
  * This application webscrapes https://travel.usnews.com/ for data on a user-chosen city.
  * With this application's intuitive and interactive HTML web service, the user has full control when chosing activities to do.
  * Custom built python algorithms utilize the google maps API to plan optimal routes through all user-chosen activites.
  * The application then autonomously provides an optimal and informative schedule for the user's vacation allowing for user adjustment.

## Skills I Learned

  * Webscraping in Python
  * HTML + CSS + JS web design
  * Implementing greedy algorithms + applications in graph theory
  * Utilizing the google maps API
  * Flask + jinja framework
